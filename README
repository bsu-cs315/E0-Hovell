Report:
  I followed the step-by-step tutorial instructions written on the Godotengine.org website titled "Your first 2D game".
  From this process, I learned how to import asset files, create basic nodes, write scripts that include player input and movement,
  spawn entities that have randomized movement, add changing GUI, and control basic music and sound effects through Godot.
